COLOR MIXER

- Add a header with three sliders (input with type range)
- The sliders will control the values for a rgb color (one slider for red, one slider for green, one slider for blue)
- Once a slider is moved the background color of the web app is updated
- Also show the color value in the header (can be in hex or as a rgb value like this rgb(xx,xx,xx))
- Load a default color an the beginning (i.e. hotpink or dodgerblue)
